# AI-Agents

This repository contains a collection of AI-powered projects showcased on my website. These projects include:

- **Air Tic Tac Toe**: A gesture-controlled Tic Tac Toe game
- **AirDraw**: A hand gesture-based drawing application
- **Object Detection**: Computer vision project for detecting objects
- **WBR Automation**: Workflow automation tools
- **Instagram Scraper**: Tool for extracting data from Instagram
- **Web Scraper**: General-purpose web scraping utility

## Development Approach

This repository showcases projects built using **Prompt-Oriented Programming (POP)** â€”a paradigm that goes beyond simple prompt engineering. POP is about delegating tasks to AI, focusing on how to make AI work better rather than just writing beautiful code ourselves. It emphasizes **workflow design** and **AI-human collaboration** to optimize software development.

All projects were created purely through AI-generated prompts, without traditional manual coding, demonstrating the power of modern AI tools.
